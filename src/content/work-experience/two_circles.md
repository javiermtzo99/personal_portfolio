Joined Two Circles as a full-time Data Engineer on the Social Data team, working on the Hookit product. Our team handles large amounts of data from social platforms covering athletes, teams, and professional sports in general. Since joining, I’ve contributed in the following areas:

**Analytical Database Migration**
- Contributed to a major migration project, moving and backfilling data from SQL Server into Snowflake using different technologies like Airflow, Snowflake stored procedures, etc.

**Supporting Customer Success**
- Hookit has over 13 years of history with lots of legacy systems. To help navigate this, I’ve taken on support escalations, troubleshooting issues and working directly with the Customer Success team.
- Used my knowledge to automate repetitive tasks by building quick software solutions with Streamlit and Snowflake, creating simple step-by-step tools that make it easier for Customer Success to handle recurring but complex issues.

Tech stack used: Airflow, Python, Snowflake, SQL Server
