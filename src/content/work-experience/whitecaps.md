This Capstone Project is part of my Master's degree in Data Science at the University of British Columbia, designed to bridge academia and industry by applying classroom knowledge to solve real-world industry problems. Working closely with the Vancouver Whitecaps, I tackled a sports analytics challenge: identifying set-piece (corners and free kicks) strategies correlated with increased scoring chances.
