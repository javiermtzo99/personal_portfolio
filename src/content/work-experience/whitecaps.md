This Capstone Project is part of my Master's degree in Data Science at the University of British Columbia, designed to bridge academia and industry by applying classroom knowledge to solve real-world industry problems. Working closely with the Vancouver Whitecaps, I tackled a sports analytics challenge: identifying set-piece (corners and free kicks) strategies correlated with increased scoring chances. My contributions included:

- **Statistical Analysis:**
    - Conducted an extensive statistical exploration using player tracking and event data sourced from the Whitecaps' Data Warehouse, after signing an NDA to ensure data confidentiality.
    - Identified and validated key features statistically linked to higher probabilities of scoring goals from set pieces.
- **Predictive Modeling:**
    - Developed an embedded predictive model leveraging machine learning techniques to forecast the likelihood of scoring from future set-piece scenarios under specific game conditions.
    - Integrated model predictions as actionable insights for coaching and analytical teams to inform strategic decision-making during matches.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis Tool:**
    - Designed and implemented a user-friendly web dashboard tailored specifically for sports analysts, presenting statistical insights and model predictions in an intuitive interface.
    - Ensured accessibility for non-technical stakeholders by creating visualizations and interactive components that effectively communicated complex data insights.
