short: Developing end‑to‑end ML solutions from prototype to production.

Although my professional roles have centered on data engineering, my Master’s in Data Science has given me a foundation in machine learning. Through coursework and independent projects I have designed and implemented solutions across the full ML spectrum:

Technical strengths:
- Supervised learning: end‑to‑end modeling pipelines with scikit‑learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, Random Forests, etc. Covering feature engineering, hyper‑parameter tuning and model evaluation
- Unsupervised learning: word‑embedding methods (Word2Vec, GloVe), topic modeling with LDA and BERTopic, and recommender systems that leverage collaborative and content‑based filtering
- Deep learning: hands‑on experience building and fine‑tuning CNNs, RNNs/LSTMs, and Transformer architectures in PyTorch.
- MLOps fundamentals: experiment tracking in MLflow, version control with DVC, and containerized deployment prototypes on AWS (ECR/ECS)
- Project mindset: rapid‑prototyping notebooks promoted to production‑ready code, clear documentation and visualization of model insights for non‑technical stakeholders.

While I have not yet held a formal Machine Learning Engineer title, I consistently seek out ML‑focused projects—ranging from sports‑analytics models to NLP prototypes—to deepen my expertise. I approach each new challenge with the curiosity and discipline needed to translate state‑of‑the‑art research into practical, business‑ready solutions.
