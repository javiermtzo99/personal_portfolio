Even though most of my professional work has been in data engineering, my Master’s in Data Science gave me a solid foundation in machine learning. Through courses and side projects, I’ve had the chance to design and build solutions across the Machine Learning space:

Technical strengths:
- Supervised learning: end-to-end pipelines using scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, Random Forests — including feature engineering, tuning, and evaluation
- Unsupervised learning: word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe), topic modeling (LDA, BERTopic), and recommender systems (both collaborative and content-based)
- Deep learning: building and fine-tuning CNNs, RNNs/LSTMs and Transformer models with PyTorch
- MLOps fundamentals: MLflow for experiment tracking, DVC for versioning and deploying containerized prototypes on AWS (ECR/ECS)
- Project mindset: starting with quick prototypes in notebooks, then turning them into production-ready code and making sure insights are clearly documented for non-technical teams

I haven’t had an official “Machine Learning Engineer” title yet, but I keep taking on ML-related projects. From sports analytics models to NLP experiments, I like approaching new challenges with curiosity and a focus on making research ideas work in real-world settings.
