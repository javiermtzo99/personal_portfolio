short: Crafting robust full‑stack applications and API‑driven services.

My software‑engineering background rounds out my data skill set, letting me deliver end‑to‑end products that are as dependable as they are user‑friendly.

Key strengths
- Full‑stack development: modern web/mobile apps and APIs (REST, GraphQL, Webhooks) with React/React native, Astro, and Next.js on the front-end, paired with Django, Node.js and FastAPI on the back-end
- Engineering fundamentals: solid grounding in data structures & algorithms, software‑design patterns, and agile methodologies
- Quality & reliability: comprehensive testing strategies, CI/CD pipelines, and automated deployments for rapid yet safe iteration
- Operations: microservices architecture and Docker‑based containerization for scalable, maintainable services
- Lifecycle stewardship: clear documentation, observability, and structured maintenance processes that keep applications healthy in production

I continually evaluate new languages, frameworks, and architectural patterns to ensure each solution is the best possible fit for the problem at hand.
