UBC’s MDS condenses a traditional two-year curriculum into four consecutive terms of fast-paced, five-week modules. The schedule demands full-time dedication, swift context-switching, and disciplined workload management, mirroring the intensity of real-world data projects.

The program’s fast-paced format combines Statistics, Machine Learning, and practical Data Science skills in every five-week module. Instead of learning each topic separately, you work on theory, modeling, and engineering at the same time. This setup keeps everything connected and helps you quickly switch between analysis, building models, and using cloud tools, just like in real-world data science projects.
### **Core Pillars & Representative Topics**

**Statistics & Inference**
- Probability foundations, hypothesis testing, and statistical inference
- Linear & generalized regression, Bayesian methods
- Experimentation design and causal-inference techniques

**Machine Learning & AI**
- Supervised modelling and feature/model selection
- Deep learning architectures and training pipelines
- Unsupervised, spatial, and temporal models
- Introductory natural language processing  

**Production-Ready Data Science**
- End-to-end workflows with Git, Docker, automated testing, and CI/CD
- Python packaging & publishing to PyPI
- Cloud computing on AWS.

### **Capstone Project – Vancouver Whitecaps FC (2 months)**
- Applied the full stack of skills to build a set-piece analytics platform for Vancouver Whitecaps FC. Everything from data engineering to model deployment and visualization.
