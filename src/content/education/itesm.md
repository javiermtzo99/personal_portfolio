I completed a 4.5-year Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Engineering at Tecnológico de Monterrey, where I combined strong academic training with hands-on experience. Some key highlights include:

- **Engineering Fundamentals:**
    - Completed foundational engineering coursework over two years, covering topics such as Physics, Calculus, Electricity and Magnetism and Numerical Methods in Engineering.
        
- **Relevant Coursework:**
    - Acquired strong programming and software development skills through courses in Data Structures, Software Engineering and Web and Mobile Development, among many others completed during the program.
        
- **Minor in Data Science:**
    - Started my journey in Data Science during the final 1.5 years by pursuing a minor, which introduced me to key data-driven methodologies.
        
    - Connected with industry professionals through this minor, notably meeting the CTO of Kuona, who was my part-time professor for the Introduction to Data Science course, leading to a subsequent role as a Data Engineer at Kuona.
        
- **Professional Experience Integration:**
    - Managed simultaneous commitments by working full-time in my final year while attending evening lectures, demonstrating strong organizational and time-management skills.
        
- **Social Service Contribution:**
    - Developed an integrated inventory management system for CAMMI (Centro de Atención al Migrante), a non-profit dedicated to supporting migrants, as part of my social service requirement.
        
- **Athletic Involvement:**
    - Competed as an athlete on the university's American football varsity team for three years, balancing athletic discipline with academic rigor.
